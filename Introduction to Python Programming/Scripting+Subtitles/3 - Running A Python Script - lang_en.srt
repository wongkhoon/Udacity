1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,955
Now that you've successfully installed Python,

2
00:00:02,955 --> 00:00:06,169
let's try to run a script in your terminal.

3
00:00:06,169 --> 00:00:09,689
First, download the file first_script.py

4
00:00:09,689 --> 00:00:14,334
attached at the bottom of this page and move it to an appropriate directory.

5
00:00:14,335 --> 00:00:19,190
I put my file here by dragging it from the downloads folder to this folder.

6
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:21,075
This might be a good time to set up

7
00:00:21,074 --> 00:00:24,730
a new directory for your learning if you don't have one already.

8
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:27,600
Next, open your terminal and use CD

9
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:31,340
to navigate to the directory containing the downloaded file.

10
00:00:31,339 --> 00:00:38,070
I can double check that the file is located here by typing ls or dir on Windows.

11
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:40,409
Now that you're in the directory with the file,

12
00:00:40,409 --> 00:00:43,319
you can run it by typing python followed by

13
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:47,304
the name of the file like this. Then press enter.

14
00:00:47,304 --> 00:00:51,134
You'll know you've run the scripts successfully if you see this message.

15
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:55,844
Whenever you type Python followed by the file name for a Python script,

16
00:00:55,844 --> 00:01:00,664
that script is run and the output is shown immediately afterwards.

17
00:01:00,664 --> 00:01:02,429
Once the codes finished running,

18
00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:04,379
and all the output has been shown,

19
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:07,074
your command line prompt reappears.

20
00:01:07,075 --> 00:01:10,920
Note if you typed and entered just Python without a script to run,

21
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:14,340
it'll start an interactive interpreter for Python.

22
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,480
You'll learn more about this later.

23
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:21,885
For now, you can just type in exit with parentheses to get out or alternatively,

24
00:01:21,885 --> 00:01:27,719
control D on Mac and Linux or control Z and enter on Windows.

25
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:30,269
Now, I'm back to the command line prompt.

26
00:01:30,269 --> 00:01:35,000
It's your turn. Download the file below and run the script in your terminal.
