00:00:02,859 --> 00:00:05,599
In all of the previous lessons,

2
00:00:05,599 --> 00:00:09,619
we've been using these boxes to represent a code editor where

3
00:00:09,619 --> 00:00:13,844
we wrote our Python code and output window where we viewed results.

4
00:00:13,845 --> 00:00:15,245
And in the classroom,

5
00:00:15,244 --> 00:00:18,705
you use these programming quizzes to write Python and run

6
00:00:18,705 --> 00:00:22,850
your code but instead of running your code online in the classroom,

7
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:26,240
you can run Python on your own computer by installing

8
00:00:26,239 --> 00:00:29,989
Python and useful tools for your programming environment.

9
00:00:29,989 --> 00:00:33,394
Since Python is a popular open-source programming language,

10
00:00:33,395 --> 00:00:34,700
it's free to download,

11
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:39,140
change and use and the fact that it's already popular means

12
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:41,240
there are online instructions to help you get it

13
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:44,150
installed for most common operating systems.

14
00:00:44,149 --> 00:00:46,949
Because it's popular and open-source,

15
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:50,660
there's a large global community working on developing Python.

16
00:00:50,659 --> 00:00:52,669
For you, as a Python user,

17
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:57,760
that means there'll be new versions coming out as Python is improved by the community.

18
00:00:57,759 --> 00:01:02,299
You might find yourself needing to update Python from time to time especially if you're

19
00:01:02,299 --> 00:01:04,640
collaborating with other people as you write

20
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,534
Python programs that are compatible with the version they're using.

21
00:01:08,534 --> 00:01:11,000
Now, it's time for you to install Python.
