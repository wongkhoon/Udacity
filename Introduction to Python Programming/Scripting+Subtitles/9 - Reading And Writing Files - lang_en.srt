1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,330
In order for a program to be really useful,

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:06,254
it needs to interact with real-world data.

3
00:00:06,254 --> 00:00:11,370
Images, web pages, and databases are all examples of files,

4
00:00:11,369 --> 00:00:14,070
and we routinely create, move,

5
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:17,925
manipulate, and read these files in our daily digital lives.

6
00:00:17,925 --> 00:00:21,420
All the data we've used so far has been defined inside

7
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:26,820
the Python script or raw input from the user during execution of the script.

8
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:31,890
Next, we're going to massively increase the variety of what we can achieve in

9
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:37,155
our Python programming by introducing how to read and write files in Python.

10
00:00:37,155 --> 00:00:40,425
This will allow us to interact with and process

11
00:00:40,424 --> 00:00:44,070
larger amounts of information from many more sources.

12
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:47,895
All kinds of files have a similar structure on a computer.

13
00:00:47,895 --> 00:00:51,930
There are strings of characters that encode some information.

14
00:00:51,929 --> 00:00:53,969
The specific file format,

15
00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:58,448
often indicated by the extension of the file name such as.py,

16
00:00:58,448 --> 00:01:02,730
TXT, HTM, CSV, and many more,

17
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:06,224
will indicate how those characters are organized.

18
00:01:06,224 --> 00:01:09,059
The characters in a file are interpreted by

19
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:12,225
the various programs we use to interact with them.

20
00:01:12,224 --> 00:01:15,299
For example, an image editing program will interpret

21
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:19,620
the information of a digital photograph file and display the image.

22
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:22,275
If we then edit the image in the program,

23
00:01:22,275 --> 00:01:26,535
were using this program to make changes to the characters in the file.

24
00:01:26,534 --> 00:01:30,159
In Python, we can read those file characters directly.

25
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:35,344
The experience will seem quite different from opening a file in a desktop application.

26
00:01:35,344 --> 00:01:38,105
Opening files in Python gives us

27
00:01:38,105 --> 00:01:41,240
a common programmatic interface to all kinds of

28
00:01:41,239 --> 00:01:44,824
files without the need for a graphical user interface,

29
00:01:44,825 --> 00:01:49,500
which means we can automate tasks involving files with Python programs.
